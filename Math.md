**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Mains Specific Topics:** The topics in *italics* represent areas that are either significantly more complex in the Mains exam or are exclusively tested in the Mains.
*   **Increased Difficulty:**  Even for topics that appear in both Prelims and Mains, the difficulty level is substantially higher in the Mains.
*   **Focus on Analysis and Application:** The Mains exam places greater emphasis on analytical skills, logical reasoning, data interpretation, and the ability to apply concepts to solve complex problems.
*   **Computer Aptitude in Mains:** While Computer Aptitude is often merged with Reasoning in the Mains, some exams may have it as a separate section. The topics may be slightly more advanced than what's expected in Prelims.
