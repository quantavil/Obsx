# RULE 1:  Verb + Preposition Collocations

Some verbs in English are followed by specific prepositions. These pairings (collocations) are often **idiomatic**, meaning they don’t always follow a logical rule and must be **memorized or learned through exposure**.

| Verb          | Preposition             | Example Sentence                                                                              | Notes                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Depend**    | on                      | "It depends on the weather."                                                                  | "Depend of" or "depend to" are incorrect. |
| **Believe**   | in                      | "She believes in hard work."                                                                  | "Believe to" is incorrect here.           |
| **Arrive**    | at/in                   | "They arrived at the hotel." / "She arrived in New York."                                     | "Arrive to" is incorrect.                 |
| **Look**      | at / for / after / into | "Look at the sky." / "Look for your keys." / "Look after the baby." / "Look into the matter." | Each preposition changes the meaning.     |
| **Apologize** | for                     | "He apologized for the mistake."                                                              | Not "apologize about."                    |
| **Succeed**   | in                      | "She succeeded in getting the job."                                                           | "Succeed to do" is incorrect.             |
| **Agree**     | with / on / to          | "I agree with you." / "We agreed on the price." / "She agreed to the proposal."               | Different meanings.                       |
|               |                         |                                                                                               |                                           |

### Idiomatic Verb-Preposition Combinations

|Combination|Meaning|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Come across**|Find unexpectedly|"I came across an old friend."|
|**Run into**|Meet unexpectedly|"I ran into my professor at the mall."|
|**Look forward to**|Eagerly anticipate|"I look forward to the meeting."|




# RULE 2: **Proximity in Subject-Verb Agreement**  

Proximity agreement means that when two subjects are joined by **"or," "nor," "either...or," or "neither...nor,"** the verb agrees with the subject **closest to it** (rather than the entire compound subject).  



### **1. Singular + Singular → Singular Verb**  
If the **closest subject is singular**, the verb must be singular.  
- ✅ *Neither Rohit **nor** Mohit **was** there.*  
- ✅ *Either the manager **or** the assistant **has** the keys.*  

❌ Incorrect: *"Neither Rohit nor Mohit **were** there."* (Misuse of plural verb)  

### **2. Plural + Plural → Plural Verb**  
If the **closest subject is plural**, the verb must be plural.  
- ✅ *Neither the students **nor** the teachers **were** present.*  
- ✅ *Either the dogs **or** the cats **are** causing the noise.*  

❌ Incorrect: *"Neither the students nor the teachers **was** present."* (Misuse of singular verb)  

### **3. Singular + Plural (or Plural + Singular) → Verb Matches the Closer Subject**  
- ✅ *Neither the teacher **nor** the students **know** the answer.* (Plural "students" → plural verb)  
- ✅ *Neither the students **nor** the teacher **knows** the answer.* (Singular "teacher" → singular verb)  

❌ Incorrect: *"Neither the students nor the teacher **know** the answer."* (Should be *"knows"*)  


### **Exceptions & Tricky Cases**  

#### **1. Mixed Persons (I, you, he, etc.)**  
When subjects are different persons, **formal grammar prefers proximity agreement**, but rephrasing is often better.  
- ✅ *Neither you **nor** he **is** responsible.* (Singular "he" → "is")  
- ❌ *Neither you nor he **are** responsible.* (Incorrect in formal writing)  

**Better Alternative:** *"You are not responsible, and neither is he."*  

#### **2. "Not only...but also" Follows Proximity Too**  
- ✅ *Not only the students **but also** the teacher **was** surprised.*  
- ✅ *Not only the teacher **but also** the students **were** surprised.*  

#### **3. "Or" vs. "And":**

- **"And"** creates a plural subject (no proximity needed):
    - _The book and the pen **are** on the table._
- **"Or"/"Nor"** triggers Proximity Agreement.


# RULE 3: **Collective Units as Singular: 

When a **quantity, measurement, or collective unit** (distance, time, money, weight, etc.) is treated as **a single whole**, it takes a **singular verb**, even if the noun appears plural in form.  

### **Examples:**  
✅ **Correct (Singular Verb):**  
- *Five kilometres **is** a long walk.* (Single distance)  
- *Ten dollars **is** too much for a coffee.* (Single amount of money)  
- *Two hours **is** enough time.* (Single block of time)  

❌ **Incorrect (Plural Verb):**  
- *Five kilometres **are** a long walk.*  
- *Ten dollars **are** too much for a coffee.*  
- *Two hours **are** enough time.*  

### **A. Measurements (Distance, Weight, Volume)**  
- *Fifty miles **is** a long drive.*  
- *Three kilograms **is** the maximum allowed.*  
- *Ten litres **is** enough water for the trip.*  

### **B. Money & Prices**  
- *A hundred rupees **is** not much these days.*  
- *Five thousand dollars **was** the final price.*  

### **C. Time Durations**  
- *Thirty minutes **is** the waiting period.*  
- *Two years **is** a long time to wait.*  

### **D. Mathematical Quantities**  
- *Five plus five **equals** ten.*  
- *Fifty percent **is** a good score.*  

- **If the unit acts as a single measurement → Singular verb.**  
- **If the focus is on individual parts → Plural verb.**  
 
### **E. When Referring to Individual Units (Not a Collective Whole)**  
- *The last two kilometres **were** the hardest.* (Emphasizing separate parts)  
- *Ten dollars **were** scattered on the table.* (Individual bills, not a sum)  

### **F. When the Subject is Explicitly Plural**  
- *Two hours of meetings **were** exhausting.* (Refers to multiple meetings, not a single block of time)  


| Type         | Example (Singular Verb)           | Example (Plural Verb, if Different Meaning)   |     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --- |
| **Distance** | *Ten miles **is** far.*           | *The last two miles **were** tough.*          |     |
| **Money**    | *A thousand rupees **is** a lot.* | *These five-dollar bills **are** fake.*       |     |
| **Time**     | *Two hours **is** enough.*        | *Two hours of lectures **were** boring.*      |     |
| **Weight**   | *Five kilos **is** heavy.*        | *The five kilos **were** weighed separately.* |     |

# **Mastering the Infinitive: A Comprehensive Guide**

### 1. What is an Infinitive?

The infinitive is the most basic form of a verb. It is the version of the verb you will find in a dictionary. It does not show a specific tense (past, present, future) or subject.

There are two main types of infinitives:

1. **The Full Infinitive (or to-infinitive):** This is the form most people recognize.
    - **Structure:** to + base form of the verb
    - **Examples:** to run, to eat, to think, to be, to have
        
2. **The Bare Infinitive (or Zero Infinitive):** This is the infinitive without the word to.
    - **Structure:** base form of the verb
    - **Examples:** run, eat, think, be, have

### **2. The Full Infinitive (`to + verb`): Key Uses & Rules**

The full infinitive is extremely versatile and can function as a noun, an adjective, or an adverb.

#### **2.1 As the Subject of a Sentence**
This usage is often seen in formal or philosophical statements.
*   **To err** is human; **to forgive** is divine.
*   **To travel** around the world requires a lot of money.
*   **To understand** quantum physics is my lifelong goal.
    *   *Note:* In everyday speech, we often rephrase this using a gerund (*Traveling around the world...*) or an "it" construction (*It requires a lot of money to travel...*).

#### **2.2 To Express Purpose (The Infinitive of Purpose)**
This is one of the most common uses. The infinitive answers the question "**Why?**".
*   I went to the library **to study**. (Why did you go? To study.)
*   She is saving money **to buy** a new car. (Why is she saving money? To buy a car.)
*   He called me **to ask** for advice. (Why did he call? To ask for advice.)
    *   *Formal alternatives:* "in order to" or "so as to".
        *   We must work together **in order to succeed**.
        *   She spoke quietly **so as not to wake** the baby.

#### **2.3 After Certain Verbs**
Many verbs are followed directly by a full infinitive. These often relate to thoughts, feelings, plans, or intentions.

*   **Verbs of desire/intention:** *want, wish, hope, plan, decide, expect, aim*
    *   I **want to leave** now.
    *   They **plan to get** married next year.
    *   We **decided not to go** to the party.
*   **Verbs of agreement/refusal:** *agree, refuse, promise, offer, threaten*
    *   She **agreed to help** us.
    *   He **refused to answer** the question.
    *   I **promise to be** on time.
*   **Other common verbs:** *learn, manage, fail, afford, seem, appear, pretend*
    *   He is **learning to speak** Japanese.
    *   We **managed to finish** the project ahead of schedule.
    *   She **seems to be** very tired.

#### **2.4 After Verbs + Object**
A very common pattern is `Verb + Object + Full Infinitive`. Here, the infinitive describes an action that the object is told, allowed, or wanted to do.
*   **Common verbs:** *ask, tell, allow, permit, advise, encourage, force, invite, order, persuade, remind, teach, want*
    *   The teacher **told us to be** quiet.
    *   My parents don't **allow me to stay** out late.
    *   She **persuaded him to join** the team.
    *   Please **remind me to call** my mom.

#### **2.5 After Adjectives**
Infinitives are used to give a reason or context for an adjective.
*   **Pattern:** `(It is) + Adjective + (for someone) + to-infinitive`
    *   It is **important to be** patient.
    *   This exercise is **difficult to understand**.
    *   I was **happy to hear** the good news.
    *   It was **kind of you to help** me.

#### **2.6 After Nouns**
An infinitive can modify a noun, explaining its purpose or function.
*   I need **a reason to believe** you.
*   It's time **to go**.
*   She has the **ability to solve** complex problems.
*   His **decision to quit** his job shocked everyone.


### 3. The Bare Infinitive (Verb without `to`): Key Rules & Usage

The bare infinitive is used in fewer situations, but they are very common ones.

#### **Rule 1: After Modal Verbs**

Always use the bare infinitive after modal auxiliary verbs.

*   **Modal Verbs:** `can`, `could`, `may`, `might`, `will`, `would`, `shall`, `should`, `must`.
*   **Exception:** The modal `ought` is followed by the `to`-infinitive (`ought to`).

*   **Examples:**
    *   You **can go** now. (NOT: *You can to go.*)
    *   We **must finish** our homework.
    *   She **should call** her parents.
    *   He **will be** here soon.

#### **Rule 2: After Verbs of Perception (`see`, `hear`, `feel`, `watch`, `notice`)**

Use the pattern: **`verb` + `object` + `bare infinitive`**. This describes seeing or hearing an entire action from start to finish.

*   **Examples:**
    *   I **saw him leave** the house. (I saw the whole action.)
    *   Did you **hear the baby cry**?
    *   We **watched them play** the match.

>**Contrast with Gerunds:** Using an `-ing` form after these verbs suggests watching an action *in progress*.
>
>*   I saw him **leave**. (I saw the entire event of him leaving).
>*   I saw him **leaving**. (I saw him in the middle of the process of leaving).

#### **Rule 3: After the Causative Verbs `make` and `let`**

Use the pattern: **`make`/`let` + `object` + `bare infinitive`**.

*   `make` = to force or compel someone to do something.
*   `let` = to allow or permit someone to do something.

*   **Examples:**
    *   My manager **made me work** late. (NOT: *made me to work*)
    *   His jokes **make me laugh**.
    *   Please **let me know** your decision.
    *   My parents **let me stay** up late on weekends.

#### **Rule 4: After `had better` and `would rather`**

These expressions are followed by the bare infinitive.

*   **Examples:**
    *   You **had better hurry** or you'll be late.
    *   I **would rather stay** home than go to the party.

### 4. Infinitives vs. Gerunds (-ing Form): The Great Divide

This is a major source of confusion. Some verbs can only be followed by one or the other, while some can take both.

**A. Verbs that take BOTH with NO change in meaning:**
*   `start`, `begin`, `continue`, `love`, `like`, `hate`, `prefer`
*   *I **started to learn** Spanish.* = *I **started learning** Spanish.*
*   *She **loves to swim**.* = *She **loves swimming**.*

**B. Verbs that take BOTH with a SIGNIFICANT change in meaning:**

| Verb | Meaning with Infinitive (`to` + verb) | Meaning with Gerund (`-ing`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **stop** | To pause one action to do another. (Purpose) | To end or quit an action completely. |
| | *I stopped **to tie** my shoelace.* | *He stopped **smoking** last year.* |
| **remember** | To not forget to do something (future action). | To recall a past memory. |
| | *Remember **to lock** the door.* | *I remember **locking** the door.* |
| **forget** | To fail to do something you were supposed to do. | To lose the memory of a past event. |
| | *I forgot **to call** him.* | *I'll never forget **seeing** the Grand Canyon.* |
| **try** | To make an effort or attempt to do something difficult. | To do something as an experiment to see what will happen. |
| | *I tried **to open** the jar, but it was stuck.* | *If you have a headache, try **drinking** some water.* |
| **regret** | To be sorry for something you are about to do (formal, often in bad news). | To be sorry for something you did in the past. |
| | *We regret **to inform** you that your application was unsuccessful.* | *I regret **not studying** harder for the exam.* |



### 5. Common Errors & Pitfalls

1.  **Adding `to` after a modal verb.**
    *   **Incorrect:** *I can `to play` the guitar.*
    *   **Correct:** *I can `play` the guitar.*

2.  **Forgetting `to` after a verb that requires it.**
    *   **Incorrect:** *I want `go` home.*
    *   **Correct:** *I want `to go` home.*

3.  **Using a gerund instead of a purpose infinitive.**
    *   **Incorrect:** *I study hard `for passing` my exams.*
    *   **Correct:** *I study hard `to pass` my exams.*

4.  **Using a `to`-infinitive after `make` or `let`.**
    *   **Incorrect:** *She made me `to clean` my room.*
    *   **Correct:** *She made me `clean` my room.*

5.  **Confusing the verbs that change meaning (e.g., `stop`, `remember`).**
    *   **Incorrect:** *I stopped `to smoke` two years ago.* (This means you paused to have a cigarette).
    *   **Correct:** *I stopped `smoking` two years ago.* (This means you quit the habit).

### 6. Practical Tips for Mastery

1.  **Learn Verbs in Chunks:** Don't just learn the verb `decide`. Learn the chunk `decide to`. Don't just learn `enjoy`; learn `enjoy -ing`. This builds automatic, correct usage patterns.

2.  **Use Mnemonics:** For verbs that take an infinitive (`want`, `hope`, `agree`, `promise`, `decide`), create a silly sentence to help you remember.
    *   **Example:** "We **WANT** and **HOPE** you **AGREE** and **PROMISE** **TO DECIDE**."

3.  **Practice Parallel Structure:** When you make a list of actions, keep the verb forms consistent. This makes your writing clear and elegant.
    *   **Incorrect:** *I like `to hike`, `swimming`, and `to read` books.*
    *   **Correct (Infinitives):** *I like `to hike`, `to swim`, and `to read` books.*
    *   **Correct (Gerunds):** *I like `hiking`, `swimming`, and `reading` books.*

4.  **Rephrase to Check Purpose:** If you are unsure whether to use an infinitive to show purpose, try rephrasing the sentence with "in order to". If it makes sense, the `to`-infinitive is correct.
    *   **Sentence:** *He works out `to stay` healthy.*
    *   **Check:** *He works out `in order to stay` healthy.* (This works!)
5.  **Focus on the "Why":** Remember that the infinitive is the go-to form for explaining the **purpose** of an action. If you can ask "Why?" and the verb answers it, you almost certainly need a `to-infinitive`.
    *   *Why are you exercising?* **To get** fit.
    *   *Why did you call?* **To tell** you the news.


# **Parallelism in Verb Forms**

Parallelism means making items in a list or series grammatically the same. For verbs, this creates **rhythm, clarity, and balance.**    

### **1. Rules and Principles**

Verbs connected by conjunctions like *and, but, or* must have the same grammatical form.

*   **Base Form:** She likes to **run**, **jump**, and **swim**.
*   **-ing Form (Gerund):** She enjoys **running**, **jumping**, and **swimming**.
*   **Past Tense:** Yesterday, she **ran**, **jumped**, and **swam**.
*   **Paired Conjunctions:** The structure must also match with pairs like *not only...but also* and *either...or*.
    *   He wants **either** *to get a promotion* **or** *to find a new job*.

| Incorrect (Non-Parallel)                               | Correct (Parallel)                                                                        | Explanation                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The dog likes *running, to play,* and *eating*.        | The dog likes *running, playing,* and *eating*.                                           | All verbs are now in the gerund (`-ing`) form.                                |
| The coach told the players *to listen to the instructions* and *that they should be on time*. | The coach told the players *to listen to the instructions* and *to be on time*. | Both items are now infinitive phrases.                                      |
| He *walked* to the store, *bought* milk, and then *is returning* home. | He *walked* to the store, *bought* milk, and then *returned* home.                      | All verbs are now in the simple past tense.                                 |
| The plan was *not only to increase sales* but also *improving customer service*. | The plan was *not only to increase sales* but also *to improve customer service*. | Both phrases after the correlative conjunction are now infinitives.         |


### **2. Common Pitfalls**

Be on the lookout for these common mistakes in your writing.

1.  **Mixing Verb Forms (The Infinitive/Gerund/Past Tense Mess)**
    This is the most frequent error.
    *   **Error:** The job requires you *to be analytical, writing clearly,* and *spoke publicly*.
    *   **Fix:** The job requires you *to be analytical, to write clearly,* and *to speak publicly*.

2.  **Shifting Tense Unnecessarily**
    If actions occur at the same time, keep the tense consistent.
    *   **Error:** She *opened* the book and *begins* to read.
    *   **Fix:** She *opened* the book and *began* to read.

3.  **Shifting Voice (Active vs. Passive)**
    Mixing active and passive voice in a series can be jarring and confusing.
    *   **Error:** The committee *approved the budget*, and a statement *was released* by the chairperson. (Active, then Passive)
    *   **Fix:** The committee *approved the budget* and *released* a statement. (Both Active)
4.  She decided not only to apply for the job but also **to prepare thoroughly for the interview**.
