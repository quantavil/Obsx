# **RULE 4: The Ultimate Guide to Linking Words**

Of course! Here is a detailed guide to the seven coordinating conjunctions, often remembered by the mnemonic **FANBOYS**.

## Coordinating Conjunctions

Coordinating conjunctions are the essential glue of English grammar. Their primary job is to connect grammatically equal elements. This can mean connecting:

*   **Words:** `salt and pepper`
*   **Phrases:** `over the river and through the woods`
*   **Independent Clauses:** `She went to the library, but he stayed home.` (An independent clause is a group of words that can stand alone as a complete sentence).

The mnemonic **FANBOYS** helps you remember all seven:

*   **F**or
*   **A**nd
*   **N**or
*   **B**ut
*   **O**r
*   **Y**et
*   **S**o


Before we dive into each word, let's cover the most important punctuation rule associated with them.

**Rule:** When a coordinating conjunction joins two **independent clauses**, you must place a comma **before** the conjunction.

*   **Formula:** `[Independent Clause] , [Coordinating Conjunction] [Independent Clause].`
*   **Example:** `The sun was setting, so we decided to head back to camp.`
*   **Incorrect:** `The sun was setting so we decided to head back to camp.` (This is a run-on sentence).

**Exception:** If the two independent clauses are very short and closely related, the comma may be omitted for stylistic reasons.
*   **Example:** `She spoke and he listened.`


### **1. AND**

**Use:** **Addition, Combination, or Sequence.** It is the most common conjunction and is used to add one element to another.

*   **To connect two or more nouns:** `I need to buy milk, bread, and eggs.`
*   **To connect two verbs or verb phrases:** `He ran down the street and jumped over the fence.`
*   **To connect two independent clauses:** `The team practiced hard for months, and they finally won the championship.`

**Examples:**
*   `She is smart and kind.` (Connecting two adjectives)
*   `We can watch a movie or play a board game.` (Wait, that's "or"... let's stick to "and"!)
*   `The rain fell, and the wind howled.` (Connecting two independent clauses)
*   `First, crack the eggs into a bowl, and then whisk them lightly.` (Showing sequence)

**Common Pitfalls:**
*   **Overuse:** Using "and" repeatedly can make your writing sound monotonous and simplistic. Try varying your sentence structure or using other transitional words.
    *   **Weak:** `I went to the store, and I bought some apples, and then I went home, and I made a pie.`
    *   **Better:** `After going to the store to buy apples, I went home and made a pie.`
*   **The Oxford (or Serial) Comma:** Forgetting the comma before "and" in a list of three or more items can sometimes cause confusion.
    *   **Ambiguous:** `I’d like to thank my parents, Ayn Rand and God.` (Are the parents Ayn Rand and God?)
    *   **Clear:** `I’d like to thank my parents, Ayn Rand, and God.`

### **2. BUT**

**Use:** **Contrast or Exception.** It is used to show a difference, opposition, or something unexpected between two elements.

*   **To connect two independent clauses:** `I want to go to the concert, but I have to study for my exam.`
*   **To connect two phrases or words:** `The book is short but powerful.`

**Examples:**
*   `He is a talented musician, but he rarely practices.`
*   `She tried to lift the box, but it was too heavy.`
*   `Everyone was invited but me.` (Here "but" acts like a preposition meaning "except").

**Common Pitfalls:**
*   **Confusing with "However":** "But" is a conjunction, while "however" is a conjunctive adverb. They require different punctuation.
    *   **Correct:** `I like the car, but it is too expensive.`
    *   **Correct:** `I like the car; however, it is too expensive.`
    *   **Incorrect:** `I like the car, however, it is too expensive.` (This is a comma splice).

### **3. OR**

**Use:** **Choice, Option, or Alternative.** It presents a choice between two or more possibilities.

*   **To connect two options:** `Would you like tea or coffee?`
*   **To connect two independent clauses:** `You can submit your assignment today, or you can ask for an extension.`

**Examples:**
*   `We can go to the beach or stay home and relax.`
*   `Hurry up, or we will be late.`
*   `He is either very brave or very foolish.` (Used with "either").

**Common Pitfalls:**
*   **Ambiguity:** "Or" can sometimes be unclear whether it means "A or B (but not both)" or "A or B (or both)." Context usually clarifies this, but in legal or technical writing, "and/or" is sometimes used (though many style guides dislike it).
*   **Subject-Verb Agreement:** When "or" connects two subjects, the verb agrees with the subject **closer** to it.
    *   **Correct:** `Either my brothers or my sister **is** going to help.` (Sister is singular).
    *   **Correct:** `Either my sister or my brothers **are** going to help.` (Brothers is plural).

### **4. NOR**

**Use:** **Joining Two Negative Alternatives.** It is the negative form of "or" and is used to continue a negative statement. It requires a specific sentence structure.

**Rule:** When "nor" connects two independent clauses, you must **invert** the subject and verb in the second clause.

*   **Formula:** `[Negative Independent Clause], nor + [Auxiliary Verb] + [Subject] + [Main Verb].`

**Examples:**
*   `She doesn't like mushrooms, nor does she enjoy onions.`
*   `He did not apologize, nor did he offer any explanation.`
*   `I am not a fan of horror movies, nor is my wife.`

**Common Pitfalls:**
*   **Forgetting Inversion:** The most common mistake is forgetting to flip the subject and verb.
    *   **Incorrect:** `He won't attend the meeting, nor he will send a representative.`
    *   **Correct:** `He won't attend the meeting, nor **will he** send a representative.`
*   **Using with a Positive Clause:** "Nor" must follow a negative statement (e.g., one containing `not`, `never`, `no`).
    *   **Incorrect:** `I like dogs, nor do I like cats.` (The first part is positive).

### **5. FOR**

**Use:** **Reason or Cause.** It provides a justification for the preceding clause. It is a more formal and literary synonym for "because."

*   **Rule:** "For" as a conjunction **only** joins independent clauses and **always** has a comma before it.

**Examples:**
*   `I have to find a new job, for I am unemployed.`
*   `The villagers always stayed indoors after dark, for they believed the forest was haunted.`
*   `She was revered by her students, for she was a patient and dedicated teacher.`

**Common Pitfalls:**
*   **Confusing with the Preposition "For":** The word "for" is much more common as a preposition. The conjunction "for" explains the *reason why* for the first clause.
    *   **Preposition:** `I bought a gift for you.`
    *   **Conjunction:** `I went to bed, for I was exhausted.`
*   **Sounding Overly Formal:** In everyday speech and informal writing, "because" or "so" are much more common. Using "for" can sound a bit stilted or archaic.

### **6. SO**

**Use:** **Result, Effect, or Consequence.** It shows that the second clause is the result of the first clause.

*   **To connect two independent clauses:** `It started to rain, so I opened my umbrella.`

**Examples:**
*   `The traffic was terrible, so we were late for the movie.`
*   `He studied diligently for weeks, so he felt confident on the day of the test.`
*   `There was a power outage, so all the clocks need to be reset.`

**Common Pitfalls:**
*   **Overuse:** Like "and," "so" can be overused, making writing feel simplistic. Consider words like "therefore," "consequently," or "as a result" for more formal writing.
*   **The "So That" Confusion:** "So" shows a result. "So that" shows a purpose.
    *   **Result (so):** `It was cold, so I put on a jacket.` (The coldness *caused* me to wear a jacket).
    *   **Purpose (so that):** `I put on a jacket so that I wouldn't get cold.` (My *purpose* for wearing a jacket was to avoid cold).

### **7. YET**

**Use:** **Contrast with an Element of Surprise.** It functions similarly to "but," but it often emphasizes a more surprising, unexpected, or ironic contrast.

*   **To connect two independent clauses:** `The movie received terrible reviews, yet I found it quite enjoyable.`

**Examples:**
*   `He claims to be a minimalist, yet his house is filled with expensive gadgets.`
*   `The sun was shining brightly, yet the air was still cold.`
*   `It's a very simple plan, yet it's the one most likely to succeed.`

**Common Pitfalls:**
*   **Confusing with the Adverb "Yet":** The adverb "yet" usually relates to time and means "up until now."
    *   **Adverb:** `Have you finished your homework yet?`
    *   **Conjunction:** `The path was steep, yet he climbed it easily.`
*   **When to Use "But" vs. "Yet":** Use "but" for a simple, direct contrast. Use "yet" when the contrast is more surprising or defies expectations. "Yet" often carries a sense of "despite this."

## Subordinating Conjunctions

Subordinating conjunctions are words that connect an **independent clause** (a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence) with a **dependent clause** (a clause that cannot stand alone and *depends* on the main clause for its meaning).

The subordinating conjunction begins the dependent clause and explains its relationship to the main clause—showing a connection of time, cause, contrast, or condition.

*   **Independent Clause:** `We cancelled the picnic.` (A complete sentence)
*   **Dependent Clause:** `because it started to rain` (An incomplete thought)
*   **Full Sentence:** `We cancelled the picnic because it started to rain.`


The punctuation for subordinating conjunctions depends entirely on the position of the dependent clause.

**Rule 1:** When the dependent clause comes **BEFORE** the independent clause, use a comma to separate them.
*   **Formula:** `[Subordinating Conjunction + Dependent Clause] , [Independent Clause].`
*   **Example:** `**Although** she was tired, she finished the race.`

**Rule 2:** When the dependent clause comes **AFTER** the independent clause, do **NOT** use a comma.
*   **Formula:** `[Independent Clause] [Subordinating Conjunction + Dependent Clause].`
*   **Example:** `She finished the race **although** she was tired.`


### **Group 1: Cause / Reason**

These conjunctions explain the *why* behind the main clause.

#### **BECAUSE**
*   **Use:** To show a direct and primary cause or reason. It is the most common and straightforward conjunction for this purpose.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `He was late **because** his car broke down.`
    *   `**Because** the weather was beautiful, we decided to eat outside.`
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   **Redundancy with "The reason is...":** Avoid the phrase "The reason is because..." It's redundant.
        *   **Weak:** `The reason we failed is because we didn't prepare.`
        *   **Better:** `We failed because we didn't prepare.` or `The reason we failed is that we didn't prepare.`

#### **SINCE**
*   **Use:** To show a reason that is already known or obvious to the listener/reader, similar to "given that." It can also refer to time (see Group 3).
*   **Examples:**
    *   `**Since** you have already finished your chores, you can go out and play.`
    *   `I'll let you pay for dinner, **since** you insisted.`
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   **Ambiguity:** "Since" can mean both "because" and "from that time until now." If your sentence could be confusing, use "because" for clarity.
        *   **Ambiguous:** `He has been nervous since he lost his job.` (Is he nervous *because* he lost his job, or has he been nervous from the *moment* he lost it?)

#### **AS**
*   **Use:** To provide a background or secondary reason. It is often more formal and less direct than "because."
*   **Examples:**
    *   `**As** it was getting dark, we hurried home.`
    *   `He agreed to the plan, **as** he had no better ideas.`
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   **Ambiguity:** Like "since," "as" is a versatile word that can also mean "while" or "in the capacity of." For clarity of reason, "because" is usually the better choice.

---

### **Group 2: Contrast / Concession**

These conjunctions introduce a clause that contrasts with or concedes a point in the main clause.

#### **ALTHOUGH / THOUGH / EVEN THOUGH**
*   **Use:** To show contrast or an unexpected outcome. They all mean "in spite of the fact that."
    *   **Although:** Standard and slightly formal.
    *   **Though:** More common in speech and writing. Can also be used as an adverb.
    *   **Even though:** The most emphatic, used for a strong or surprising contrast.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `**Although** he studied hard, he failed the exam.`
    *   `She bought the dress **though** it was expensive.`
    *   `**Even though** he was terrified, he walked onto the stage.`
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   **"Though" as an adverb:** Be aware that "though" can appear at the end of a sentence as an adverb, where it functions like "however."
        *   `He failed the exam. He studied hard, **though**.` (Here, it's an adverb, not a conjunction).
    *   **Using with "but":** Do not use "although/though" in the same sentence as "but." It's redundant.
        *   **Incorrect:** `Although he was rich, but he was unhappy.`
        *   **Correct:** `Although he was rich, he was unhappy.`

#### **WHILE / WHEREAS**
*   **Use:** To show a direct contrast or comparison between two things.
    *   **While:** Can mean "at the same time" (see Group 3) or "in contrast to."
    *   **Whereas:** Used exclusively for direct comparison and is more formal.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `**While** my brother loves action movies, I prefer comedies.`
    *   `The north side of the city is wealthy, **whereas** the south side is impoverished.`
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   **Ambiguity of "While":** If the contrast meaning of "while" could be confused with its time meaning, use "whereas" or "although" for clarity.


### **Group 3: Time**

These conjunctions situate the main clause in time.

#### **WHEN / WHENEVER**
*   **Use:**
    *   **When:** Refers to a specific moment or period in time.
    *   **Whenever:** Refers to any time or every time something happens.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `The crowd cheered **when** the team scored.`
    *   `**Whenever** I hear that song, I think of my childhood.`

#### **BEFORE / AFTER**
*   **Use:** To show a clear chronological sequence.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `Look both ways **before** you cross the street.`
    *   `**After** the storm passed, a rainbow appeared in the sky.`

#### **UNTIL**
*   **Use:** To indicate that an action continued up to a certain point in time and then stopped.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `We waited **until** the sun went down.`
    *   `You are not allowed to leave **until** you finish your homework.`
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   **Using "'Til":** "Till" is a recognized, older variant of "until." However, "'til" is a common but often-criticized informal spelling. For formal writing, stick to "until."

#### **ONCE**
*   **Use:** To mean "as soon as" or "from the moment that."
*   **Examples:**
    *   `**Once** you learn to ride a bike, you never forget.`
    *   The dog calms down **once** he gets to know you.

---

### **Group 4: Condition**

These conjunctions introduce a condition upon which the main clause depends.

#### **IF**
*   **Use:** To introduce a condition that must be met for something to happen.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `**If** you finish your work early, you can go home.`
    *   `We will have the party inside **if** it rains.`

#### **UNLESS**
*   **Use:** To introduce a negative condition. It means "except if."
*   **Examples:**
    *   `You will not pass this class **unless** you study.` (You will not pass *except if* you study).
    *   `**Unless** there is an emergency, do not press the red button.`
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   **Double Negatives:** Avoid using "unless" with "not" in the same clause, as it creates a confusing double negative.
        *   **Incorrect:** `I won't go **unless** she doesn't come.`
        *   **Better:** `I will only go if she doesn't come.` OR `I won't go if she comes.`

---

### **Group 5: Place**

These conjunctions introduce a clause related to location.

#### **WHERE / WHEREVER**
*   **Use:**
    *   **Where:** Refers to a specific place.
    *   **Wherever:** Refers to any place.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `This is the spot **where** we had our first picnic.`
    *   `You can sit **wherever** you like.`
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   **As a Relative Pronoun:** These words can also start relative clauses, which describe nouns. The function is slightly different, but the grammar is similar.
        *   `I live in a city **where** it never snows.` (Describes the noun "city").


---

## Conjunctive Adverbs & Transitional Phrases

Unlike true conjunctions (like FANBOYS or subordinating conjunctions), these words and phrases are not grammatical "glue." They are adverbs that function as transitions.

Their job is to show the **logical relationship** between two complete, independent sentences. They act as signposts for your reader, indicating how the idea in the second sentence relates to the idea in the first.


This is where most mistakes are made. Because these words connect two **independent clauses**, you cannot use a simple comma.

**Method 1: The Semicolon (Connects two clauses in one sentence)**
This method shows a very close relationship between the two ideas.

*   **Formula:** `[Independent Clause]; [Conjunctive Adverb], [Independent Clause].`
*   **Example:** `The final exam was difficult; however, I felt prepared.`

**Method 2: The Period (Separates into two sentences)**
This is the most common and often clearest method.

*   **Formula:** `[Independent Clause]. [Conjunctive Adverb], [Independent Clause].`
*   **Example:** `The final exam was difficult. However, I felt prepared.`

**Method 3: As an Interrupter (Within a single clause)**
A conjunctive adverb can also interrupt a single clause for emphasis.

*   **Formula:** `[Subject], [Conjunctive Adverb], [Verb phrase].`
*   **Example:** `I, however, felt prepared.`

**THE BIGGEST PITFALL TO AVOID: The Comma Splice**
You **cannot** join two independent clauses with a conjunctive adverb and only a comma. This is a very common grammatical error.

*   **INCORRECT:** `The final exam was difficult, however, I felt prepared.`
 -  **CORRECT:** `The final exam was difficult. However, I felt prepared.` OR `The final exam was difficult, but I felt prepared.`

### **Group 1: To Show Contrast or Opposition**

#### **HOWEVER, IN CONTRAST, ON THE OTHER HAND**
*   **Use:** To introduce a statement that opposes or contrasts with the previous one. `However` is the most versatile. `In contrast` and `on the other hand` emphasize a direct comparison between two specific things.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `The company's profits have soared; however, its stock price has fallen.`
    *   `The city's east side is primarily residential. In contrast, the west side is packed with industrial buildings.`
    *   `I want to go out tonight. On the other hand, I really should stay home and study.`
*   **Common Pitfalls:** Using `but` and `however` together. They serve the same function. Choose one.
    *   **Incorrect:** `He is a great leader, but however, he can be indecisive.`

#### **NEVERTHELESS, NONETHELESS**
*   **Use:** These are strong words used to introduce a contrast that is surprising in light of the previous statement. They mean "in spite of that." They are formal and largely interchangeable.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `The flight was delayed for three hours; nevertheless, we arrived at our destination on time.`
    *   `The evidence against him was overwhelming. Nonetheless, the jury found him not guilty.`

### **Group 2: To Show a Result or Consequence**

#### **THEREFORE, CONSEQUENTLY, THUS**
*   **Use:** To show that the second clause is the logical result or effect of the first. `Therefore` is standard. `Consequently` emphasizes a direct consequence. `Thus` is more formal and often used to introduce a summary or conclusion.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `He was caught cheating on the exam; therefore, he was expelled.`
    *   `The storm knocked out the power lines. Consequently, the entire town was without electricity.`
    *   `The data shows a clear correlation. Thus, we can conclude the experiment was a success.`
*   **Common Pitfalls:** Overuse in informal writing. In casual contexts, "so" (a coordinating conjunction) is often more natural.

### **Group 3: To Add Information or Reinforce an Idea**

#### **FURTHERMORE, MOREOVER, ADDITIONALLY, BESIDES, ALSO**
*   **Use:** To add another point or piece of evidence to support the same argument. `Furthermore` and `moreover` are quite formal. `Additionally` is standard. `Besides` implies "and another thing..." `Also` is very common but can feel weaker.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `The plan is too expensive. Furthermore, it will take years to complete.`
    *   `You need to finish your report. Besides, you still have to reply to those emails.`
    *   `She is an expert in her field; additionally, she is a fantastic public speaker.`
*   **Common Pitfalls:** `Also` and `Besides` have flexible placement. When `also` starts a sentence, it requires a comma. When placed within, it often doesn't. `Besides` can also be a preposition (`Besides me, who else is coming?`).

### **Group 4: To Emphasize or Clarify**

#### **FOR EXAMPLE, FOR INSTANCE**
*   **Use:** To introduce a specific example that illustrates the previous point. They are interchangeable.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `Many animals are nocturnal; for example, the owl hunts for food at night.`
    *   `He has many good habits. For instance, he wakes up early every day to exercise.`

#### **IN FACT, INDEED**
*   **Use:** To confirm or emphasize the truth of the previous statement, often with a surprising or more specific detail.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `He is a great student. In fact, he has the highest grades in the entire school.`
    *   `The work was difficult; indeed, it was one of the hardest projects I've ever tackled.`

### **Group 5: To Show Sequence or Time**

#### **FIRST, SECOND, NEXT, THEN, FINALLY**
*   **Use:** To organize ideas in a chronological or logical order.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `First, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Next, mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl.`
    *   `We worked all day on the proposal. Finally, at 10 p.m., we were ready to submit it.`
*   **Common Pitfalls:** The word `then` is flexible. In a simple sequence, the comma is often omitted (`I went to the store, then went home.`). However, when used as a formal transitional word between two independent clauses, it follows the standard semicolon or period rule (`We reviewed the data; then, we made our decision.`).

#### **MEANWHILE**
*   **Use:** To indicate that something else was happening at the same time as the action in the first clause.
*   **Example:**
    *   `The leaders were trying to negotiate a peace treaty; meanwhile, the fighting on the border intensified.`

### **Group 6: To Show Similarity**

#### **SIMILARLY, LIKEWISE**
*   **Use:** To show that the second clause is similar to or agrees with the first. They are largely interchangeable.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `Reading a book can transport you to another world. Similarly, a great film can make you forget your surroundings.`
    *   `You must submit the form by the deadline; likewise, all fees must be paid in full.`

### **Group 7: To Show an Alternative or Condition**

#### **INSTEAD**
*   **Use:** To present an alternative or replacement for the idea in the first clause.
*   **Example:**
    *   `We had planned to go hiking; instead, we stayed home and watched a movie because of the rain.`

#### **OTHERWISE**
*   **Use:** To show the negative consequence or result if the first clause does not happen.
*   **Example:**
    *   `You must leave now; otherwise, you will miss your flight.`

## Prepositions

These are not true conjunctions. Their grammatical job is to show the relationship between a **noun** (or noun phrase, pronoun, or gerund) and the rest of the sentence.

They link an *idea* (expressed as a noun/phrase) to a main clause, but they do **not** link two full clauses together.


### **The Most Critical Rule**

A preposition or prepositional phrase **must** be followed by a noun, pronoun, or gerund (-ing form of a verb used as a noun). It **cannot** be followed by a full clause (subject + verb).

*   **Formula:** `[Prepositional Phrase + Noun/Gerund], [Independent Clause].`
    *   **Example:** `**Despite the rain**, we enjoyed the game.`

*   **Formula:** `[Independent Clause] [Prepositional Phrase + Noun/Gerund].`
    *   **Example:** `We enjoyed the game **despite the rain**.`

**THE BIGGEST PITFALL TO AVOID:** Confusing these with subordinating conjunctions.

*   **Incorrect (Preposition + Clause):** `Despite it was raining, we enjoyed the game.`
*   **Correct (Preposition + Noun):** `Despite the rain, we enjoyed the game.`
*   **Correct (Conjunction + Clause):** `Although it was raining, we enjoyed the game.`


### **Group 1: To Show Contrast or Concession**

#### **DESPITE / IN SPITE OF**
*   **Use:** To introduce a factor that would be expected to prevent the result in the main clause, but doesn't. They mean "even with" or "notwithstanding." They are completely interchangeable.
*   **Followed by:** A noun or a gerund (-ing verb).
*   **Examples:**
    *   `**Despite the heavy traffic**, we arrived on time.` (Followed by a noun phrase)
    *   `She passed the exam **in spite of** not studying very much.` (Followed by a gerund)
    *   `**Despite** feeling ill, he went to work.` (Followed by a gerund)
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   **The Clause Mistake:** As mentioned above, the number one error is following them with a subject and verb.
        *   **Incorrect:** `In spite of he is old, he runs marathons.`
        *   **Correct:** `In spite of his age, he runs marathons.`
        *   **Correct:** `In spite of being old, he runs marathons.`
    *   **"Despite of":** The word "of" follows "in spite," but **never** "despite."
        *   **Incorrect:** `Despite of the cost, I bought the ticket.`
        *   **Correct:** `Despite the cost, I bought the ticket.`

### **Group 2: To Show Cause or Reason**

#### **DUE TO / BECAUSE OF**
*   **Use:** To give the reason or cause for something. In modern English, they are largely interchangeable.
*   **Followed by:** A noun or a gerund.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `The flight was cancelled **due to** the snowstorm.` (Followed by a noun phrase)
    *   `**Because of** the delay, we missed our connecting flight.` (Followed by a noun)
    *   `He succeeded **because of** working hard.` (Followed by a gerund)
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   **The Clause Mistake:** Confusing them with the conjunction `because`.
        *   **Incorrect:** `The game was postponed due to it was raining.`
        *   **Correct:** `The game was postponed due to the rain.`
        *   **Correct:** `The game was postponed because it was raining.`
    *   **"Due to" vs. "Because of" (A Minor, Old-Fashioned Rule):** Some traditional grammarians argue that `due to` should only be used as an adjective phrase (modifying a noun), while `because of` should be used as an adverbial phrase (modifying a verb).
        *   **Traditional:** `His failure was due to a lack of effort.` (`due to...` describes the noun `failure`).
        *   **Traditional:** `He failed because of a lack of effort.` (`because of...` describes the verb `failed`).
        *   **Modern Usage:** This distinction is now widely ignored. You can use them interchangeably without issue in almost all contexts.

### **Group 3: To Show Reference or Topic**

These prepositions introduce the source of information or narrow the topic of the main clause.

#### **ACCORDING TO**
*   **Use:** To cite the source of information. It tells the reader where an idea or fact came from.
*   **Followed by:** A noun (the source).
*   **Examples:**
    *   `**According to** the weather forecast, it will rain tomorrow.`
    *   `The earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old, **according to** scientists.`
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   **Citing Yourself:** It is unnatural in English to say "According to me..." or "According to my opinion..."
        *   **Incorrect:** `According to me, this is the best movie of the year.`
        *   **Correct:** `In my opinion, this is the best movie of the year.`

#### **REGARDING / CONCERNING**
*   **Use:** To mean "about" or "on the subject of." They are used to introduce the topic that is being discussed. They are more formal than "about."
*   **Followed by:** A noun or a gerund.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `I am writing **regarding** the job opening advertised on your website.`
    *   `**Concerning** your recent request, we have attached the necessary documents.`
    *   `He has several questions **regarding** paying his taxes.`
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   **Overly Formal Tone:** In casual conversation or informal writing, these words can sound stuffy or overly formal. Often, the simpler word "about" works just as well.
        *   **Formal:** `I have a question concerning the new policy.`
        *   **Informal:** `I have a question about the new policy.`
    *   **"As regards":** The phrase `as regards` is a common alternative, but `regarding` is usually more concise and preferred.

## Correlative Conjunctions

Correlative conjunctions are pairs of conjunctions that work together to connect two balanced or grammatically equal elements in a sentence. Unlike a single conjunction, they are split up and placed around the words, phrases, or clauses they are connecting.

The key to using them correctly is to ensure the elements they connect are of the same grammatical type.


**The Critical Rule: Parallel Structure (Parallelism)**

This is the most important concept for using correlative conjunctions correctly. The structure of the grammatical element following the *first* part of the conjunction must be identical to the structure of the element following the *second* part.

*   **Noun with Noun:** `You can have **either** the soup **or** the salad.`
*   **Verb with Verb:** `He will **both** wash the car **and** mow the lawn.`
*   **Adjective with Adjective:** `She is **not only** smart **but also** kind.`
*   **Prepositional Phrase with Prepositional Phrase:** `The treasure is hidden **neither** under the bridge **nor** inside the cave.`

**THE BIGGEST PITFALL TO AVOID:** Violating parallelism.

*   **INCORRECT (Violates Parallelism):** `She is not only famous in her country but also a writer of many books.`
    *   `famous in her country` = adjective + prepositional phrase
    *   `a writer of many books` = noun phrase
*   **CORRECT (Parallel):** `She is not only famous in her country but also popular in other nations.` (prepositional phrase // prepositional phrase)
*   **CORRECT (Parallel):** `She is not only a famous person but also a great writer.` (noun phrase // noun phrase)


### **1. both... and**

*   **Use:** To emphasize that two things are included or true. It is an inclusive conjunction.
*   **Grammar Point:** The subject `both A and B` is always considered plural and takes a plural verb.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `She can **both** sing **and** dance.` (Connecting two verbs)
    *   `The new policy affects **both** students **and** teachers.` (Connecting two nouns)
    *   `I am **both** tired **and** hungry.` (Connecting two adjectives)
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   **Subject-Verb Agreement:** Forgetting that the subject is plural.
        *   **Incorrect:** `Both the dog and the cat **is** sleeping.`
        *   **Correct:** `Both the dog and the cat **are** sleeping.`
    *   **Parallelism:** Placing `both` in the wrong spot.
        *   **Incorrect:** `He **both** enjoys hiking **and** to swim.` (gerund // infinitive)
        *   **Correct:** `He enjoys **both** hiking **and** swimming.` (gerund // gerund)

### **2. either... or**

*   **Use:** To present a choice between two options. It is an exclusive conjunction (one or the other, but not both).
*   **Grammar Point:** For subject-verb agreement, the verb agrees with the subject that is **closer** to it.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `You can have **either** the pizza **or** the pasta for dinner.`
    *   `We can **either** watch a movie at home **or** go to the theater.`
    *   `The package will arrive **either** today **or** tomorrow.`
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   **Subject-Verb Agreement (Proximity Rule):** This is a very common point of confusion.
        *   **Correct:** `Either my aunts or my mother **is** going to host the party.` (Mother is singular and closer to the verb `is`).
        *   **Correct:** `Either my mother or my aunts **are** going to host the party.` (Aunts is plural and closer to the verb `are`).

### **3. neither... nor**

*   **Use:** To negate both parts of the statement. It means "not the first one and not the second one."
*   **Grammar Point:** Like `either...or`, the verb agrees with the subject that is **closer** to it.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `He is **neither** a good singer **nor** a good dancer.`
    *   `I have time for **neither** video games **nor** television this week.`
    *   `**Neither** the students **nor** the teacher **was** prepared for the fire drill.`
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   **Double Negatives:** `Neither...nor` already provides the negation. Do not add another negative word like `not` or `don't`.
        *   **Incorrect:** `I don't want **neither** the coffee **nor** the tea.`
        *   **Correct:** `I want **neither** the coffee **nor** the tea.`
    *   **Using with "Or":** The partner for `neither` is always `nor`.
        *   **Incorrect:** `He is **neither** happy **or** sad.`
        *   **Correct:** `He is **neither** happy **nor** sad.`

### **4. not only... but also**

*   **Use:** To emphasize a second, often more surprising or important, element that is being added to the first.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `The car is **not only** fast **but also** fuel-efficient.`
    *   `She **not only** wrote the script **but also** directed the movie.`
    *   `**Not only** did he finish the project ahead of schedule, **but he also** won an award for it.`
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   **Parallelism:** This pair is the most common victim of parallelism errors due to the placement of `not only`.
        *   **Incorrect:** `He **not only** likes apples **but also** bananas.` (The parallel elements are "apples" and "bananas," so `not only` is misplaced).
        *   **Correct:** `He likes **not only** apples **but also** bananas.`
    *   **Inversion:** When `Not only` starts a sentence, the subject and verb of that first clause must be inverted (like in a question).
        *   **Incorrect:** `Not only he is smart, but also he is funny.`
        *   **Correct:** `Not only **is he** smart, but he is also funny.`
    *   **Omitting "also":** In formal writing, `also` should be included. In informal speech, it's often dropped (`She's not only smart but funny.`).

### **5. whether... or**

*   **Use:** To present two alternatives or possibilities, often in a case of doubt or choice. It can introduce an indirect question.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `I can't decide **whether** I should accept the job **or** keep looking.`
    *   `The real question is **whether** to proceed **or** to cancel the project.`
    *   `**Whether** you succeed **or** fail, your effort is what truly matters.`
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   **Confusing with "if":** Use `if` for a conditional statement. Use `whether` to show a choice between two possibilities, especially when the word `or` is present.
        *   **Conditional (If):** `Let me know **if** you are going to the party.` (I only need to know about the "yes" case).
        *   **Choice (Whether):** `Let me know **whether** you are going to the party **or** not.` (I am asking about both possibilities).
    *   **Redundant "or not":** Often, the "or not" is implied and not necessary.
        *   `I don't know whether I should go.` (The "or not" is understood).
        *   However, sometimes "or not" is essential for meaning: `Whether or not you like it, you have to clean your room.`

## Quick Reference Chart: Linking Words & Phrases


### **1. COORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS (FANBOYS)**
**Rule:** Use a comma before the conjunction when joining two independent clauses. `[Clause], for [Clause].`

| Conjunction | Function/Use                  | Example                                        | Key Pitfall / Punctuation                             |
| :---------- | :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **F**or     | Shows Reason (like 'because') | I went inside, **for** it had started to rain. | Formal. Always use a comma before it.                 |
| **A**nd     | Adds information              | He washed the car, **and** she dried it.       | Avoid overuse. Use a serial comma in lists.           |
| **N**or     | Joins two negatives           | He doesn't drink, **nor** does he smoke.       | **Inversion is required** in the 2nd clause.          |
| **B**ut     | Shows Contrast                | I like apples, **but** I prefer bananas.       | Don't use with `however` in the same clause.          |
| **O**r      | Presents a choice/option      | We can go now, **or** we can wait.             | Verb agrees with the subject closer to it.            |
| **Y**et     | Shows surprising contrast     | The solution was simple, **yet** effective.    | Stronger/more surprising than `but`.                  |
| **S**o      | Shows a result/consequence    | She studied hard, **so** she passed the test.  | Shows a *result*, not a *purpose* (that's 'so that'). |


### **2. SUBORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS**
**Rule:** If the sentence starts with the conjunction, use a comma. If the conjunction is in the middle, no comma is needed.
*   `**Although** it was late, we kept working.`
*   `We kept working **although** it was late.`

| Conjunction | Function/Use | Example | Key Pitfall / Punctuation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **since**, **as**, **because** | Shows Cause/Reason | We left **because** we were tired. | `Because` is most direct. `Since` and `as` can be ambiguous (also mean time). |
| **although**, **though**, **even though** | Shows Contrast/Concession | **Although** he is rich, he is not happy. | Don't use with `but`. `Even though` is strongest. |
| **while**, **whereas**| Shows direct contrast | **While** I like dogs, my sister prefers cats. | `Whereas` is more formal and only for contrast. |
| **if**, **unless** | Shows a Condition | We will go **if** the weather is nice. | `Unless` = "except if." Avoid double negatives. |
| **when**, **whenever** | Shows a Time | The phone rings **whenever** I'm in the shower. | `Whenever` means "every time." |
| **before**, **after**, **until**, **once**| Shows Time/Sequence | **Once** you finish, you can leave. | `Until` implies an action stops at a point. |
| **where**, **wherever** | Shows a Place | Sit **wherever** you feel comfortable. | `Wherever` means "any place." |


### **3. CONJUNCTIVE ADVERBS / TRANSITIONAL PHRASES**
**Rule:** Connects two sentences. Use a semicolon before or a period after. **AVOID THE COMMA SPLICE.**
*   `[Clause]; **however,** [Clause].`
*   `[Clause]. **However,** [Clause].`

| Adverb/Phrase                                   | Function/Use                  | Example                                                                         | Key Pitfall / Punctuation                               |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **however**, **in contrast**                    | Shows Contrast                | Profits are up; **however,** sales are down.                                    | **Never** `..., however, ...` to join sentences.        |
| **therefore**, **consequently**, **thus**       | Shows Result/Consequence      | He lied; **therefore,** he cannot be trusted.                                   | More formal than `so`.                                  |
| **furthermore**, **moreover**, **additionally** | Adds a related idea           | The plan is risky. **Furthermore,** it is expensive.                            | Formal way to add another point.                        |
| **meanwhile**                                   | Shows simultaneous action     | I was studying; **meanwhile,** my friends were at the party.                    | Used for a time-based contrast.                         |
| **similarly**, **likewise**                     | Shows Similarity              | You must check your work; **likewise,** you must cite sources.                  | Shows that two ideas are alike.                         |
| **for example**, **for instance**               | Gives a specific example      | Many countries face challenges; **for example,** Japan has an aging population. | Use a comma after the phrase.                           |
| **instead**, **otherwise**                      | Shows Alternative/Consequence | You need to study; **otherwise,** you will fail.                                | `Instead` = replacement; `Otherwise` = negative result. |
| **in fact**, **indeed**                         | Provides Emphasis             | He's good at his job; **in fact,** he's the best.                               | Confirms or strengthens the previous statement.         |


### **4. PREPOSITIONS USED FOR LINKING**
**Rule:** MUST be followed by a noun, pronoun, or gerund (-ing verb). **Cannot be followed by a full clause (subject + verb).**

| Preposition                   | Function/Use                     | Example                                          | Key Pitfall / Punctuation                         |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **despite**, **in spite of**  | Shows Contrast/Concession        | We went out **despite** the rain.                | **Incorrect:** `despite it was raining`.          |
| **due to**, **because of**    | Shows Cause/Reason               | The game was cancelled **because of** the storm. | **Incorrect:** `due to it was storming`.          |
| **according to**              | Cites a source                   | **According to** the report, sales are up.       | Don't say "According to me." Use "In my opinion." |
| **regarding**, **concerning** | Specifies a topic (like 'about') | I have a question **regarding** the new policy.  | More formal than `about`.                         |


### **5. CORRELATIVE CONJUNCTIONS**
**Rule:** The two elements connected must be grammatically parallel (e.g., noun with noun, verb with verb). **Parallel Structure is key!**

| Conjunction Pair         | Function/Use                     | Example (Parallel Structure)                         | Key Pitfall / Punctuation                                                |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **both... and**          | Includes two items               | I like **both** apples **and** oranges.              | Subject is always plural.                                                |
| **either... or**         | Presents a choice (A or B)       | You can have **either** the fish **or** the chicken. | Verb agrees with the noun closer to it.                                  |
| **neither... nor**       | Negates two items (not A, not B) | He speaks **neither** French **nor** Spanish.        | Avoid double negatives. Verb agrees with the noun closer to it.          |
| **not only... but also** | Adds an emphatic second point    | She is **not only** a doctor **but also** an author. | If it starts a sentence, invert the first clause. (`Not only is she...`) |
| **whether... or**        | Presents two possibilities       | I don't know **whether** to laugh **or** to cry.     | Use for a choice of alternatives, not a simple condition (that's `if`).  |
