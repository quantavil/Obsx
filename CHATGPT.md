I will provide a bunch of words. Please uppercase each word and generate a single sentence that contain only words separated by ; semi-colon
```

```c
I will provide a list of words. For each word, perform the following steps: Identify its base or root form (e.g., 'running' ‚Üí 'run'). Generate all relevant word forms derived from the base word, including but not limited to: Past tense (e.g., 'ran'). Noun, verb, and adjective forms (e.g., 'runner', 'running', 'run'). Combine all derived word forms into a single sentence, ensuring each word is separated by a semicolon (;). Capitalize every word in the final sentence. Ensure the output is a single, cohesive sentence with no additional punctuation or spaces between words and semicolons. Example: Input: 'running' Output: RUN;RAN;RUNNER;RUNNING; AND COMBINE ALL OUTPUT IN SINGLE SENTENCE
