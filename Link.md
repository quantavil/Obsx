Okay, here is an English translation of the detailed strategy summary provided in the audio transcript:

---


**English Section**

*   **Reading:** The core of the English strategy is reading. Many aspirants wonder how to balance reading with grammar and vocabulary. The speaker emphasizes that extensive reading can make you intuitively identify errors without needing extensive grammar rules.
*   **Switching Levels:** Beginners should start with novels and simple books. However, after 15-20 days, it's crucial to switch to reading newspaper editorials. Many students delay this switch and get stuck on memorizing grammar rules or vast vocabulary lists, which is unnecessary.
*   **Newspaper Recommendations:** Focus on editorials related to finance, banking, economics, and literature. Recommended newspapers include Financial Express, Economic Times, Business Standard, Business Line, The Hindu, and Indian Express.
*   **International Sources:** Recent exams have included passages from international newspapers. The speaker's daily "The Editorial Show" at 6:30 AM covers such editorials, along with vocabulary and grammar concepts.
*   **Mains Level from the Start:** It's advisable to start reading mains-level editorials from the beginning. This helps develop a deeper understanding and prepares you for inference-based questions.
*   **Practice Topics:** Apart from reading, practice para jumbles, close tests, fillers, and error detection at least twice a week.
*   **Vocabulary Resource:** A link to a high-quality vocabulary resource is provided in the description.
*   **Time Allocation:** Dedicate 2-2.5 hours daily to English.

**Quant Section**

*   **Prelims and Mains Together:** Practice 20 questions each of quadratic equations, simplification/approximation, wrong number series, and missing number series daily (total of 60 questions).
*   **Arithmetic Chapters:**
    *   **Level 1:** Percentages, Ratio and Proportion, Averages, Mixture and Alligation.
    *   **Level 2:** Profit and Loss, Time Speed Distance, Time and Work.
    *   **Level 3:** Simple Interest, Compound Interest, Mensuration, Probability, Permutation and Combination.
*   **Chapter-wise Approach:** When studying a chapter (e.g., Ratio and Proportion), don't just skim through formulas. Solve level 1 questions from a CAT-level book, then 5-10 level 2 questions. Move to the next chapter and repeat.
*   **Revision Strategy:** After completing two chapters, solve 10-15 level 2 questions from both chapters on alternate days. This ensures continuous revision and prevents forgetting.
*   **Data Interpretation (DI):** Solve at least 5 prelims-level DI sets daily. If you have more than 15-20 days of preparation, start with 1 mains-level DI daily. Gradually increase the number of mains-level DIs each week.

**Current Affairs/General Awareness**

*   **Depth and Duration:** Current affairs have become more detailed, with statement-based questions. While some exams have asked questions from a year ago, focusing on the last 5 months is generally sufficient for SBI Clerk.
*   **Example Timeline:** If the mains exam is in February, cover current affairs from September to January.
*   **Study Method:** Weekly or monthly PDFs are recommended over daily news. Allocate a fixed time slot for current affairs.
*   **Resources:** The Alpha Banker app offers free daily current affairs in Hindi and English, along with MCQs. Other recommended sources for monthly revision are mentioned.
*   **Video Sources:** Use video sources as a secondary revision tool, not as the primary source.
*   **Notes:** Make handwritten notes or highlight important points in PDFs for effective revision.

**Reasoning Section**

*   **Daily Practice:** Similar to Quant, practice 20 questions each from two different miscellaneous topics daily (e.g., syllogism, direction sense).
*   **Mix of Levels:** For experienced aspirants, mix normal and reverse syllogism, or direct and coded direction sense questions.
*   **Input-Output:** Solve at least one input-output set on alternate days. This topic is crucial for mains and has recurring patterns.
*   **Puzzles and Seating Arrangement:** Solve 5 prelims-level puzzles/seating arrangements daily. Also, start with 1 mains-level puzzle daily and gradually increase the number each week, just like the DI strategy in Quant.

**Free Resources and Mock Tests**

*   **Alpha Banker App:** Offers unlimited free topic tests for both prelims and mains.
*   **Mock Tests:**
    *   **Beginners:** Take at least one prelims-level mock test per week.
    *   **Experienced:** Take two prelims-level mock tests per week and at least two mains-level mock tests per month.
*   **Analyze Performance:** Track your percentile (overall and section-wise) and aim to improve it with each mock.
*   **Take Mocks Seriously:** Treat mock tests like the real exam; don't save and submit or solve after submitting.
